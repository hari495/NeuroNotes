Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

Key Concepts:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Training with labeled data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Common algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through rewards and penalties
   - Examples: Game AI, Robotics
   - Common algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradients

Popular Machine Learning Libraries:
- Scikit-learn: General-purpose ML library
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework by Google
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework by Meta
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting library

Common Applications:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Predictive maintenance
- Healthcare diagnostics

Best Practices:
- Always split data into training, validation, and test sets
- Perform feature engineering and selection
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Use cross-validation for model evaluation
- Monitor for overfitting and underfitting
- Document your experiments and results
